starting a new tutorial drag and drop it went well as a simple code to do 

05/11/24
today im working on a code for a jumping tutorial for my main character/box to have more functions
this might take some time.
# Update
i managed to fix the problem that would make the box drop completely by rapidly tapping the box.
made changes as the box would just fall straight away so made sure that the new code would keep it on the floor wilst still being able to keep it in the air at a time.

had a look at doing a npc chat that would allow a user to apply text and be able to press a button and moves along each sentance used it can be used depending on what you want to talk about
i looked into some examples to get an idea for the general game i would like to make in the future as an rpg type game could be a good idea
i had some problems when doing the code as it didn't align right and had made a error in spelling and not having a good layout.
19/11/24
i had started wrighting up the tutorials for the things i have made during the time in class i had finished the code required for the dialouge for the npcs to talk 
it was a simple tutorial im going to work on these for now and add more detail and videos to help show how each code works together.

26/11/24
started my prototype working on making the questions and answer with the correct one passing you through 
having a game that you are able to move on to each questions potetnially might add some more down the line if needed

# 03/12/24
found a error with the prototype that made the questions not work propley by not switching the buttons to the new line of array so the button wouldn't switch over.
so found a soultion by asking for some help fixed the problem 
im working on the wright up for the tutorial for the drag and drop system 
i had changed my mind from my main idea which was a Tower Defense game which the idea being that you place turrets around being inspired by bt6

# 10/12/2024
i have started to lose ideas or general so planning to create some fun things for the tutorials
or a good tutorial for a strong idea of wanting wanting a good idea 

16/12/2024
working harder on the tutorials including the main grammer of them havinga look into them 
so might add some fun things being able to images of things people might like as a logo for a characters
im working on the prototype for testing of the actual game going forward.

17/12/2024
testing out new questions for the game it didn't have many problem
but thinking things through errors popped up when changing the code around making it simple 
i looked at different games to gain inspo and some ideas  so stuck with the quiz game 
currently no issues have popped up 
filmed a video of the game being played did it twice one being a updated version one being the lowest.
