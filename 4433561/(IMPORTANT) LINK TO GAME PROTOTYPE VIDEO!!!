This google drive was tested in incognito to be available for dull access.

The Google drive has a link to the Game ProtoTYpe video, as well as back up copies of the .MD files for the Tutorials and the Learning Journal.

Also, would just like to say the name of this link is an old one, however their were issues when trying to rename it would update this but wouldn't change the name, and the new one wouldn't be "found."
